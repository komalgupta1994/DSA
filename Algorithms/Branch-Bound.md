# Branch And Bound Algorithm

Branch and Bound is a method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and using a bounding function to eliminate subproblems that can not contain the optimal solution. This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored. Branch and Bound is commonly used in problems like the traveling salesman and job scheduling.

To solve this we can go with BFS and 3 data structures.
1. Queue
2. Stack
3. Least
