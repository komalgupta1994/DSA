# Branch And Bound Algorithm

The Branch and Bound Algorithm is a method used in combinatorial optimization problems to systematically search for the best solution. It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, or branches, and then eliminating certain branches based on bounds on the optimal solution. This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored. Branch and Bound is commonly used in problems like the traveling salesman and job scheduling.
