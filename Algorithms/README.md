# Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithms section of this repository. Algorithms are a set of instructions that are used to perform a specific task. They are crucial for solving problems that require a structured approach.

## What's Inside?

Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder with a README file for a detailed explanation.

Here are the algorithms covered in this section:

- Backtracking
- Branch And Bound
- Brute-Force
- Dynamic-Programming
- Greedy
- KMP
- Kadane's
- Sliding-Window
- Two-Pointer

## Why Algorithms?

Understanding algorithms and how to implement them can help you solve complex problems more efficiently. They are used in many areas of computer science and programming, from data analysis to artificial intelligence.

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own set of use-cases. For example, backtracking is used for solving problems where multiple solutions may exist, and we need to find the best one. Greedy algorithms are used when we want to make the locally optimal choice at each step in the hope of finding a global optimum.
