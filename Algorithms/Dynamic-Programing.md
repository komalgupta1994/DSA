# Dynamic Programming Algorithm

Dynamic Programming is a powerful problem-solving method that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing their results using a memory-based data structure (like an array or a dictionary). The principle of dynamic programming is based on Bellmanâ€™s Principle of Optimality which provides a method to solve optimization problems. In practical terms, this approach avoids repetitive computations by storing the results of expensive function calls. This technique is widely used in optimization problems where the same subproblem may occur multiple times. Dynamic Programming is used in numerous fields including mathematics, economics, and computer science.

DP is correctness of "brute-force" and efficiency of "greedy" algorithms.
Two common use cases:
    a. Finding an optimal solutions(max or min)
    b. Counting the total number of solutions for a problem.

`DP = Recursion + Memoization`

DP says, try all the possible solutions and pick up the best solution.
