# Greedy Algorithm

Greedy algorithms follow the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are used for `optimization problems`. An optimal solution is one where the value of the solution is either maximum or minimum. In this algo, `decisions are made based on the information available at the current moment without considering the consequences of these decisions in the future`. This can lead to solutions that are less optimal. Examples of problems solved by greedy algorithms are Kruskal’s minimal spanning tree algorithm, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, and the Knapsack problem.
