# Knuth–Morris–Pratt(KMP) algorithm

In computer science, the `Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (or KMP algorithm)` is a string-searching algorithm that searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
