# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to this repository! This is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in diving deep into the world of data structures and algorithms.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains a wide variety of data structures and algorithms, each with its own dedicated README file. These README files provide a detailed explanation of the concept, its implementation, and its use-cases. This makes it easier for learners to understand the core concepts and their applications.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its versatility - from being able to run on a web browser to being used for server-side programming - makes it a great choice for implementing and understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Whether it's improving the existing code, adding new data structures or algorithms, or enhancing the documentation, your contributions can help make this resource better for everyone.

So, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository. Happy coding!
