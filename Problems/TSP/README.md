# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Greedy Algorithm in JavaScript

Welcome to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) section of this repository. The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science that focuses on optimization. In this problem, a salesman is given a list of cities, and must determine the shortest route that allows him to visit each city once and return to his original location.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of a solution for the TSP using a Greedy Algorithm in JavaScript. The Greedy Algorithm approach for the TSP picks the nearest unvisited city as the next city to visit.

## Why TSP?

The TSP has several applications, even in its purest form, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing.

## Greedy Algorithm

A Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each step by considering only the current situation, without worrying about the consequences of that choice.

## Usage

The TSP has been used in various applications including logistics, planning, DNA sequencing, and machine learning. The Greedy Algorithm approach to solving the TSP, while not always yielding the best solution, often produces solutions that are close to the best possible in a much shorter amount of time.
