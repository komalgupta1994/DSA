# Knapsack Problem in JavaScript

Welcome to the Knapsack Problem section of this repository. The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of a solution for the Knapsack Problem using JavaScript. It includes operations like calculating the maximum value that can be put in the knapsack of a given capacity.

## Why Knapsack Problem?

The Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. It's used in resource allocation where there are financial constraints, and is a good starting point to learn about dynamic programming.

## How It Works?

The solution for the Knapsack Problem can be approached by dynamic programming. The idea is to calculate the maximum value for all subproblems starting from the smallest ones, and use these solutions to construct the solution to larger subproblems.

## Usage

The Knapsack Problem has many applications in resource allocation, budgeting, finance, and in fields like genetics.
