# Data Structures in JavaScript

Welcome to the Data Structures section of this repository. Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and are the building blocks of efficient algorithms. They define the way we interact with our data, the operations we can perform on them, and the efficiency of these operations.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of various data structures using JavaScript. Each data structure has its own dedicated folder with a README file for a detailed explanation and a JavaScript implementation.

Here are the data structures covered in this section:

- Arrays
- Objects
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Binary Heap
- Graphs

## Why Data Structures?

Understanding data structures and the efficient use of them can help you write more efficient and performant code. Data structures are used in almost every aspect of computer science and programming, from writing small scripts to large-scale software systems.

## Usage

Each data structure has its own set of use-cases. For example, arrays are great for quick access to elements, while linked lists are ideal when you plan on adding or removing a lot of elements. Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Graphs are used to represent networks, such as social networks or the internet.
