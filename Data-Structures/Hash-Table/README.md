# Hash Table in JavaScript

Welcome to the Hash Table section of this repository. A hash table is a widely used data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

## What's Inside?

This section contains the implementation of a hash table in JavaScript. It covers essential operations like inserting, searching, and deleting key-value pairs, along with internal mechanisms such as hash functions and collision resolution strategies.

## Why Hash Table?

Hash tables are extremely useful when you need fast access to data using a unique key. With average-case time complexity of O(1) for most operations, they are ideal for use cases like implementing caches, dictionaries, or indexing data. Their speed and efficiency make them a staple in many algorithms and systems.

## How It Works?

A hash table uses a hash function to convert a key into an array index. This index determines where the value will be stored in the underlying array. When two keys produce the same index, a situation called a hash collision occurs. To handle collisions, techniques like chaining (storing multiple items in the same index using a list) or open addressing (probing for the next available slot) are use.

## Usage

Hash tables are used in many real-world applications, such as implementing associative arrays, databases indexing, caches, and in solving algorithmic problems like counting occurrences or checking duplicates efficiently.
