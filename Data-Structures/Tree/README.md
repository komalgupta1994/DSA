# Trees Data Structure in JavaScript

This section of the repository is dedicated to the implementation of various types of Trees data structures using JavaScript. Trees are a crucial data structure which provide a hierarchical structure in computing.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the following types of trees:

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Trie
- N-ary Tree

Each type of tree has its own dedicated section with a detailed explanation of the concept, its implementation, and its use-cases.

## Algorithms

In addition to the implementation of these trees, this section also includes algorithms for balancing trees. Balancing a tree is important to ensure efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Why Trees?

Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures allow us to write efficient algorithms for search, insert, delete operations.

## Usage

Tree data structures are used to manage hierarchical data, like the structure of a file system. They are also used in algorithms that require a hierarchical or ordered data structure, such as sorting and searching algorithms.
