# Graph Data Structure in JavaScript

Welcome to the Graph Data Structure section of this repository. A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of Graph Data Structure using JavaScript. It includes operations like adding vertices, adding edges, and traversing the graph (both breadth-first and depth-first).

## Why Graphs?

Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook.

## Subfolders

This section also includes a subfolder for Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## Usage

Graphs are used in numerous fields of computer science, including:

- Social Networks
- Web Pages Links
- Representing Networks of communication
- Representing States in AI
- Routing algorithms like OSPF
- In biology, to represent systems of biological components
- In linguistics, to represent syntactic structures of sentences
