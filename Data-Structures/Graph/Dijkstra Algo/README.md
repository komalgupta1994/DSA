# Dijkstra's Algorithm in JavaScript

Welcome to the Dijkstra's Algorithm section of this repository. Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using JavaScript. It includes operations like finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Why Dijkstra's Algorithm?

Dijkstra's Algorithm is used when we have a weighted graph and we want to find the shortest path from one node to all other nodes, or between two nodes. It's a significant algorithm with a wide range of applications.

## How It Works?

Dijkstra's Algorithm works by visiting vertices in the graph starting with the object's starting vertex. It selects the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. 

## Usage

Dijkstra's Algorithm has many applications in computer science, from network routing protocols like OSPF to theoretical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. It's also used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination.
