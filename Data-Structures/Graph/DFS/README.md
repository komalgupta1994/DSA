# Graph Traversal using Depth-First Search (DFS) in JavaScript

Welcome to the Depth-First Search (DFS) section of this repository. DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of DFS using JavaScript. It includes operations like traversing the graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search when a dead end occurs in any iteration.

## Why DFS?

DFS is used in several algorithms to explore all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order. This can be used to measure the connectivity of the graph, to generate a spanning tree, and to find paths between two nodes.

## How It Works?

DFS uses a stack to perform the traversal. It starts from the root node, explores as far as possible along each branch before retracing steps.

## Usage

DFS has many applications in computer science:

- For a weighted graph, DFS traversal can be used to find the path with the maximum (or minimum) total weight.
- DFS can be used to solve puzzles such as mazes.
- DFS can be used to find connected components in a graph.
- DFS can be used to check if a graph is bipartite.
