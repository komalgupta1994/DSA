# Graph Traversal using Breadth-First Search (BFS) in JavaScript

Welcome to the Breadth-First Search (BFS) section of this repository. BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layer-wise thus exploring the neighbor nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbor nodes.

## What's Inside?

This section includes the implementation of BFS using JavaScript. It includes operations like traversing the graph layer by layer from a selected source node.

## Why BFS?

BFS is a traversing algorithm which can be used to traverse or search through a graph in a systematic way. It's a significant algorithm with a wide range of applications.

## How It Works?

BFS starts traversal from the root node and visits nodes in a level by level manner (i.e., visiting the ones closest to the root first). BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the traversal process.

## Usage

BFS has a lot of applications in computer science:

- In web crawling, we use BFS to limit the depth of the crawling.
- In network broadcasting, BFS is used to broadcast packets.
- In garbage collection, BFS is used in Cheney's algorithm.
- In path finding, BFS can be used to find the shortest path.
